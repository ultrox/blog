I'm Marko, some guy from internet. I'm very interested (passionate if you
will), about how to hack myself to do stuff I'm interested. Sometimes I'm
successful, but sometimes not so much. I tend to procrastinate, start stuff I
don't finish, and struggle with consistency.

Struggle is real, but  over the years I figure out what works for me and learn few
things here and there. I'm self-though junky.


## I though multiple hard things:

- English & German
- Several programing languages
- Devops & automation
- Unix & Vim
- Math
- etc.

### Other people though me
- Tango
